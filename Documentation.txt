App was written in Python 2.7 using Flask framework. HTML & CSS wee used to create the front-end. Javascript & JQuery were used to link the frontend to the python code. The majority of the HTML, CSS and javascript code was altered from the tutorial linked below. Problems arose when attempting to connect mysql to the python code. This led to this app differentiating itself greatly from the tutorial code.

CouchDB was used as the database for the app. The database was hosted using Smileupps.com.

Once the wed app was ready, it needed to be hosted on a server. Heroku was used.

After deploying the app on the heroku servers, the app was uploaded to github and linked back to heroku. The app then deploys automatically when commited to github. This is an additional option that works out easier to manage.
